## Welcome!

Welcome to my Github pages. I will write here about (applied) Artificial Intelligence and put extra stuff here that I use in my classes. 

What you will find here is a combination of blogs, tutorials and notes. 

I am writing about the things that i lecture in, such as:
- Computer Vision
- Generative AI for Vision
- Large Vision models
- Data centric AI
- projects that I will do with my students.

Also I will write about the impact of AI in society and how it will change so many things.
Also some writing in Dutch.
